# Stuff
Consists of some of the self made projects which I undertook during summer of 2023

### Bingo

The bingo projects are related to creating a bingo game look-a-like which is able to keep track of the numbers that the user cuts 
and also has a score system which keep tracks of the user's score.

I further tried to test if an ordered bingo sequence has more chances of winning in a game than a completely unordered bingo sequence.

### Machine Learning

The K_Means_Clustering and Naive Bayes

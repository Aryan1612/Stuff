# Stuff
Consists of some of the self made projects which I undertook during summer of 2023

### Bingo

The bingo projects are related to creating a bingo game look-a-like which is able to keep track of the numbers that the user cuts 
and also has a score system which keep tracks of the user's score.

I further tried to test if an ordered bingo sequence has more chances of winning in a game than a completely unordered bingo sequence.

### Machine Learning

The K_Means_Clustering, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression are the machine learning models which I implemented from scratch with complete logic without the use of Sci-Kit learn's
library. I also identified the varioous hyperparameters involved in the model and then fine tuned them to obtain the best accuracy.

I compared my model's accuracy with the Sci-kit Learn model's accuracy too.

The Dataset used for training and prediction are present under the headings ds1_train, ds1_predict, ds2_train and ds2_predict respectively.
